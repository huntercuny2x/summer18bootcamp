Teaching Methodology
--------------------
This is a production-based course that involves programming work both inside and outside of the classroom. During class, code examples will be presented, written, and reviewed. Examples will iteratively build off lessons learned in preceding classes and students will be encouraged to write code, ask questions, and engage in both creative and technical discussion. The course embraces a process-oriented philosophy believing that programming, design, and web development are best learned by doing. Thus, much of class time will be spent doing hands-on workshop-style lessons and exercises.

Course Mission: L.E.G.S.
------------------------
* Learn - skills, tools, processes, techniques, resources
* Explore - challenges, risks, failures, adventures, dreams 
* Grow - advance, empower, progress, reflect, repeat
* Share - describe, document, communicate, contribute, participate
    

Homework Assignments
---------------
Each class there will be homework assignments. Homework may include reading, watching videos, doing code exercises, creating web prototypes, and completing projects. Feel free to collaborate with your classmates and work together on any assignment(s), but everyone must share/submit their own individual work.  

Class time will sometimes be spent going over assignments. Expect to be asked to show your work every class. Some classes everyone may demonstrate their work, other classes only a few students will share, but always be prepared to do so. All of your work must be completed by the time the following class session begins, unless otherwise noted.

We will be using github to turn in our assignments. For those new to git, we will go over basic usage in class. 

**Assignment Workflow**  
   1. To start, [**fork** the homework repository](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).    
   2. [**Clone**](http://gitref.org/creating/#clone) the forked repository to your computer.    
   3. Modify the files and [**commit**](http://gitref.org/basic/#commit) changes to submit your work.   
   4. [**Push**](http://gitref.org/remotes/#push)/sync the changes up to GitHub.    
   5. [Create a **pull request**](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) on the original repository to turn in the assignment. Do not merge the Pull Request.
   5. [**Updating Work**]If you make changes to your assignments and want to re-submit them for consideration/code review, commit the new changes to your repository, and make a new pull request with the word UPDATE next to your name/repository URL. You can re-submit work at any time during the TTP course.

I also recommend using Github Pages to host your projects, but you are welcome to use any hosting services that you are comofrtable with.


Attendance & Participation
--------------------------

* Attendance is mandatory. Every class builds off the previous one so it is vital to be present for every lesson. Unexcused absences or habitual lateness will negatively impact your final grade for the class. If you are going to be late or absent, please message me on Slack **in advance**. If you have an emergency, please let me know as soon as you can. You will need to communicate absences/lateness to both Sarah and Elise.

* Showing up on time, engaging in the class discussion, and offering advice and input during class is a major part of this cohort. Participating in class is helpful for me to get to know you as an individual and keep track of your progress, but most importantly, it provides you and your classmates the opportunity to share failures, successes, and insights on the work you are doing.

* Please turn in all assignments on time. You must complete all assignments and projects in order to receive a certificate of completion.

* You are expected to show work in class. This includes a working web site, a kind-of working web site, a non-working web site, a failed app, an app that works but not the way you expected it to work, and so on. Basically, don’t be afraid to volunteer to show what you did do or failed to do. Explaining your work to other people is a great way to better understand the material and answer questions for yourself. Plus, showing work that did not function as expected is not a sign of failure, it is an opportunity to learn. 

* Ask questions. If you do not ask questions, I can only assume you understand the material completely.

Laptops
-------
Laptop use will be expected in class, but should be focused on class-specific material, applications, and research. Whenever classmates are presenting please keep your laptop closed. The quality of the class depends in large part on your attention and active participation, so please respect your fellow classmates and close your lid.


Statement of Academic Integrity 
-----------
Plagiarism is presenting someone else’s work as though it were your own. More specifically, plagiarism is to present as your own: A sequence of words quoted without quotation marks from another writer or a paraphrased passage from another writer’s work or facts, ideas or images composed by someone else.
