## OO JS Mini Project

Implement an object model that allows you to store strings that represent a Photo.

* Your model should include an Album object that can contain many Photo objects in its photos attribute.

* Each Album should allow you to add a new photo, list all photos, and access a specific photo by the order it was added.

* Each Photo should tell you the photo's file name and the location the photo was taken in.

* Create instances of each object defined to prove that your object model works.
